Where is PTVS for Visual Studio 2015?
=====================================

We've started working on support for Visual Studio 2015, will be releasing PTVS 2.2 for Visual Studio 2015 when it reaches its final version.

For prerelease versions of Visual Studio 2015, we have released a [dev build](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/113962) for those who wish to test it and report issues. This build is based on PTVS 2.2 and may be unstable, as is usual for dev builds. If you find a problem, please [report it](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/issues).

To use a stable release, we recommend obtaining Visual Studio 2013 from [visualstudio.com](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs), and using [PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707).
