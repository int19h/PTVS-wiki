PyLint
======

For [PTVS 2.1](https://pytools.codeplex.com/releases/view/109707), we have added support for running [PyLint](http://pylint.org/) in PTVS.

In Solution Explorer, you'll see a command to run PyLint on your Python project node.

![PyLint Command](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/blob/master/Python/Docs/User/Images/PylintCommand.png)

If you don't have PyLint installed, it will prompt you to install it into your active Python environment.

The errors reported by PyLint will appear in the Error List window. Double-click on an error and it will take you to the source code.

The following link should render the image from the wiki repository, but it doesn't work:

[Here is an example][https://github.com/mikehadlow/WikiDemo/wiki/Main-Page] of a wiki repo that does the same thing (link to an image in its wiki repo) and where it works.
